            <p>
                <strong>Yoshito Usui</strong> (臼井 儀人, Usui Yoshito, April 21, 1958 – September 11, 2009) was a Japanese manga artist known for the popular <em>Crayon Shin-chan</em> series. He was born in Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.
            </p>
            <h2> Personal Life </h2>
            
            <p>In 1977, he graduated from Saitama Kasukabe technical high school (埼玉県立春日部工業高等学校). After graduating he attended a part-time design-related college but dropped out. In 1979, he joined an advertising company called POP Advertising. He made his debut as a cartoonist in 1987 when Weekly Manga Action began running his Darakuya Store Monogatari.</p>

            <p>In August 1990, his series Crayon Shin-chan began running in Weekly Manga Action, the series started as a spin-off of the character Shinnosuke Nikaido (二階堂信之介) of Darakuya Store Monogatari. An animated series based on the comics began in 1992, and a Crayon Shin-chan boom followed the release of a 1993 animated film. For a year beginning in 1995, Usui's Super Shufu Tsukimi-San comic strip ran in the magazine Manga Life.</p>
            
            <p>Usui was a devotee of Jehovah's Witnesses who had a church facility constructed adjacent to his home in 1994. He was known in the industry to read out the New Testament for a full 20 minutes at each meeting with his publisher and handing them out copies of the Bible as a gift.</p>
            
            <p>He and his wife raised two daughters; both had moved out of the house at the time of Usui's death.</p>

            <h2> Characteristic </h2>
            <p> Among famous Japanese cartoonists, he is one of the artists who used the simplest drawing style. I omitted most of the background or light and shade and worked only with pen lines, and I rarely used screen tones, so I filled the surface with hatching whenever possible. Even the colored illustrations are often painted in a single color without separate brightness. In fact, it is said that when he serialized Crayon Shin-chan while he was alive, he spent more time writing the story than drawing.</p>
                

            <p> At first glance, his drawing style may seem like he is not good at drawing and is completely insincere, but surprisingly, hidden within his simple drawing style are details that are clearer than expected and versatility that does not look awkward when mixed with any work. First of all, there are so many different types of appearance depending on the character, so the distinction is so clear that even if you draw a large number of characters, there is not much difference, and at the same time, you can easily depict beauty or lust, giving it a completely different feel from the drawing style of other children's cartoons. In fact, if you search online communities, you can see a lot of parodies that draw other cartoons using Crayon Shin-chan's drawing style. The difference between the drawing style and the original is quite different, but the fact that it matches strangely shows how high the level of perfection of the drawing style is.</p>
                
            <p>One thing that is unusual is that when drawing characters, frontal shots are rarely depicted . Even in scenes where the front would be more suitable, it is always drawn only from half the side, and in animation, there are many scenes where frontal shots are shown. This was due to the habit of always deciding on a side shot as the standard during the design process, but no matter how much I tried to draw it to match the composition, the proportions kept getting ruined, so I gave up on it. </p>
                
            <p>Unlike the drawing style, the story had a strong adult flavor, and Shin-chan, his representative work, was originally serialized as an adult comic for the first time.[5] All works other than Shin-chan are adult-oriented comedy comics. Because of Crayon Shin-chan's popularity, several of Yoshito Usui's other works were translated in Korea in the mid-1990s.[6] The real adult content here is of a very high standard. There are even stories of premarital pregnancy, 3rd parties, and adultery establishments.[7] Compared to these works, Crayon Shin-chan is on the side of being purified for all ages.</p>
